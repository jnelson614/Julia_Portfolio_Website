        <p>
          Since March 2021, my tenure at Motional has been marked by significant growth and involvement in various aspects of our driverless experience. My initial role involved the redesign of Command Center, a vital tool utilized by our operations teams to manage the fleet of autonomous vehicles. This endeavor entailed extensive user research with our ops team, the establishment and maintenance of a new design system, leadership in designing key features, and collaboration across teams on multiple tools and projects.
          <br>
          <br>
          In February of 2023, I transitioned to a new phase of my career by stepping into a leadership role within a high-stakes team responsible for remote vehicle assistance of our autonomous vehicles. Assuming leadership of the team's design initiatives, I ventured into the unfamiliar territory of a 3D interface, a significant shift from my background in designing 2D interfaces. After joining the team and encountering a challenging onboarding process, I developed a new onboarding experience aimed at assisting not only my new direct report but also providing valuable insights for anyone seeking to understand our team or for future team members. Alongside spearheading the design of innovative features, I became a manager of a junior designer, guiding their growth and integration into our dynamic team. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating team organization, implementing new processes, and meticulously documenting our work in a more comprehensive manner. This entailed streamlining workflows, optimizing communication channels, and crafting detailed documentation to ensure clarity and efficiency in our operations. Through my organizational efforts, I oversaw the creation of another design system with enhanced components. Having spent over a year with the team, I'm pleased with our progress and remain dedicated to ongoing improvement in my current role.

                    <p class="pb-3">
                      We were hired by our client to unify the experience of their investor applications into a single platform.
                      Since user experience had not been a significant focus of their efforts, their technology platform had evolved into
                      a large set of overlapping applications that felt disjointed when brought together. In order to unify this experience, my team created
                      a set of 150+ icons that would serve as the face of each application within the platform.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-3">
                      I collaborated with two other designers and used our typical process for UX projects to get us started. At first, we took a divide and conquor
                      approach where we each came up with different directions for the design of the application icons. The client ended up pulling elements from each
                      of our designs, and we turned these decisions into 150+ icons accompanied by a full fledged design system.
